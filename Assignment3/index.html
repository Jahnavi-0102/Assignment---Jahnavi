        <h2>About India</h2>
        <p>India is a beautiful land with a variety of wildlife and rich cultural diversity. The Bengal Tiger is considered the national animal of India. India celebrates its Independence Day on 15th August every year. It is observed to commemorate the freedom of India from the British. The tri-coloured national flag is called Tiranga, designed with saffron, white and green with the Ashok Chakra in navy blue at the centre of the flag. ‘Lion Capital of Ashoka’ is the country’s national emblem. The national motto is ‘Satyameva Jayate,’ which means truth alone wins. In order to run the country smoothly, and make it an independent country, there was a need for a constitution which came into force on 26th January 1950. We observe this day as Republic Day every year. India is a land of many different languages and many different religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Hinduism, etc. There are various food styles and dressing styles depending on the regions of the country, setting the perfect example of Unity in Diversity.</p>

        <h2>Culture Of India</h2>
        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India. The term also applies beyond India to countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration, colonisation, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country.</p>
