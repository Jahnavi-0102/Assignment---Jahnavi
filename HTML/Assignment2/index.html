            Q1. How do the elements appear? Does the width have any effect? Why / Why not?
            Ans. Elements apprearded just one after the other with a single space between them. 
                 No width did not have any effect because span is an inline element. 

        </pre>
        <pre class="Questions" id="second">
            Q2. Next, set display to inline. Does it cause any change? Why / Why not?
            Ans. No there was no change because span itself is an inline element.

        </pre>
        <pre class="Question" id="third">
            Q3. Next, change display to block. What change does it cause?
            Ans. The elements now appear one below the other in vertical order because the property has been changed to block and it takes the whole width of parent element.

        </pre>
        <pre class="Question" id="fourth">
            Q4. Next, set display to inline-block. What change does it cause?
            Ans. Now elements took the width as set. HTML and CSS are in same line with the width of 40% and JavaScript appred in next row.

                In inline element all the elements appred in same line with a single space in between them.
                In block element all the appred one below the other taking whole width of parent element.
                In inline-block element they take the width as set.
                The block elements take up the full width available.
                The inline elements take the required width to display the contents of the elements.
                Inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.
