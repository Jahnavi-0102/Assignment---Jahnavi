        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Located on the country's western coast, Gujarat is one of the most vibrant coastal states of India, rich in crafts, history and natural beauty. The place derives its name from 'Gujaratta' meaning the land of Gurjars who passed through Punjab and settled in some parts of Western India. They were the sub tribes of the Huns who ruled the area during 8th and 9th centuries AD. The history of Gujarat dates back to 2000 BC. It is believed that Lord Krishna evacuated Mathura and settled his new capital on the west coast of Surashatra at Dwarka. Gujarat is bounded by the Arabian Sea on the west, Pakistan and Rajasthan in the north and northeast respectively, Madhya Pradesh in the southeast and Maharashtra in south. Gujarat with the longest coastline (1290km) in the country is renowned for its ancient temples, virgin beaches, and historic capitals replete with immense architectural assets, wildlife sanctuaries and hill resorts. Besides its varied destinations, this industrially advanced state is also known for its fascinating handicrafts, textiles, mouthwatering cuisine, lively fairs, festivals, and the colourful lifestyle.</p>
